The turbulence was rough, but Ethan remained calm, gliding through the aisle with practiced ease, assuring passengers with his confident smile. One particularly worried passenger clung to her armrest, so he crouched beside her and whispered a joke about turbulence being "sky massages." By the end of the flight, she hugged him, her gratitude palpable.

On a snowy day, a passenger forgot their knit scarf in the overhead bin. Ethan grabbed it, sprinting through the terminal like a hero in a rom-com, catching the passenger in the nick of time. They were so touched they promised to fly the airline again solely because of Ethan.
