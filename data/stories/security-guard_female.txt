The night shift brought an eerie quiet, but Marissa kept her flashlight at hand, her steps steady. The old museum was said to be haunted, but she wasn’t afraid—until she heard a child's laughter echoing from the Egyptian exhibit. When she followed the sound, all she found was a teddy bear sitting on the floor where none had been before.
Marissa loved the routine of guarding the mall after hours, but tonight felt different. She turned a corner and found a man standing in the shadows, clearly not an employee. “You’re not supposed to be here,” she said firmly, watching as he simply nodded and walked straight through a closed glass door.
On her first day at the tech campus, Marissa accidentally locked herself in the server room. As hours passed and the temperature dropped, she realized no one was coming to help. A mischievous thought came—maybe the AI security system had a sense of humor.
Whenever Marissa walked the perimeter of the warehouse, the stray cat followed her like she was its pack leader. One night after a thunderstorm, the cat led her to a hole in the fence where someone had clearly tried to break in. The next morning, she came back with tools to fix it and an extra sandwich for her partner in crime-solving.
A child in a lost-and-found area clung to Marissa's leg, tears streaming as she waited for her parents. Hours passed, but no one came to claim him. When she asked where his parents were, he whispered, “They’re coming back…from upstairs,” but the building had no upstairs.
On Halloween night at the data center, Marissa found a prankster dressed as a ghoul in the intake lobby. She took him to the lobby camera, showing his mask as evidence for trespassing. When she checked the footage later, the mask was gone, and the man's face had never registered at all.
Marissa patrolled the empty apartment complex with ease until the swimming pool’s lights flickered without warning. Peering into its still surface, she thought she caught sight of her reflection waving back when she clearly hadn't moved. The next night, she avoided looking at the pool altogether.
The quiet hours at the art gallery were a blessing, except when the paintings shifted positions. It only ever happened in the Renaissance wing, where the faces seemed to follow her. One night, she turned off the lights and heard footsteps—soft and measured—behind her.
The bakery’s early shift was peaceful, and Marissa loved the smell of fresh bread. One morning, she caught a figure slipping in through the back only to discover there was nothing but floury footprints leading to the ceiling. The baker thanked her, though Marissa couldn’t bring herself to explain what she saw.
At the car factory, Marissa would hear faint metallic whispers, as though the machines themselves spoke. She shrugged it off until the new security cameras caught a figure in overalls—unclear and blurry—walking along the assembly line. There had been no workers scheduled after hours for nearly a year.
Marissa had grown used to checking the hotel corridors for late-night trouble. But this time, she knocked on the door of a room that shouldn't have been occupied. When it opened, the guest inside smiled at her with a face that was eerily identical to her own.
The old hospital had been closed for years, but Marissa took pride in keeping it clear of vandals. Her footsteps echoed louder than usual tonight, and as she turned a corner, she saw something written on the wall in dust: “Thank you for visiting.” She hadn't written it, nor had she seen anyone nearby.
At the stadium, Marissa walked her rounds until she noticed a single seat in the bleachers occupied. She approached the man to remind him of closing time, and before she could get close, he vanished like a shadow. The next time she checked, his soda cup was still there, unopened.
Marissa's rounds included an old library where the air smelled of paper and ink. Twice now, she’d caught a flicker of motion among the empty shelves—perhaps a breeze, she told herself. But when she found an open book she'd never touched, the name “Marissa” written in flowing script stared back at her.
The high-rise office floors had motion sensors, and Marissa often set them off by accident. But this time, a light switched on three floors below her. When she went to investigate, she found the chair in one cubicle still spinning as if the person had just left.
