Sitting on a bench in the park, he flipped through stacks of court papers. A little girl selling lemonade offered him a cup, and as he sipped, he realized the case he was working on centered on shutting down her family’s business. He closed the folder and decided some things weren’t worth winning.
The lawyer’s briefcase fell open on the subway, spilling papers everywhere. Flustered, he scrambled to collect them until an old woman handed him one sheet. “This is important,” she said, pointing at a tiny, overlooked detail, solving his case.

Once, he took on a case for an animal shelter, more out of goodwill than profit. When the shelter won, they named a rescue dog “Lawyer” in his honor. The dog barked every time he visited, tail wagging furiously.
